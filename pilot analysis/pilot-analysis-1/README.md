# Online pain monitoring study
We aim to characterize how back pain fluctuates over the scale of a few minutes by designing a continuous pain-tracking task for patients with chronic back pain. The pain tracking task involves the continuous rating of perceived intensity and a sparse sampling of pain predictions and confidence levels. The project can potentially help to better phenotype patients, which could be treated with a precision medicine approach and shed light on how to improve the quality of life of patients. The task we develop also has the potential to be incorporated into NHS digital healthcare in the future.

## Pilot Study 1

We collected data from 6 chronic pain patients through a platform called 'Prolific'. The survey consisted of an online game developed through pyschopy platform. For the first pilot study, the survey was published on 27th January 2023.
